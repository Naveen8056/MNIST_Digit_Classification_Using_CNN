# ðŸ§  MNIST Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

A simple deep learning project that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. This is a beginner-friendly project to understand the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

# Through this project, you will learn:
    1.How to preprocess image data for deep learning
    
    2.How to design and train CNN architectures
    
    3.How to evaluate model performance and make predictions
    
    4.How to save and reuse trained models

The model achieves over 98% accuracy on the test dataset, making it a reliable baseline for digit recognition tasks.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to get hands-on experience with deep learning, especially in image classification.
